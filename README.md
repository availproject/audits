At Avail, we have completed multiple audits throughout the development phase of the project. In all critical parts of the system. At the same time, we are running an ongoing bug bounty program [add link to immunefi when launched]. 

# Audits
The critical code we deploy to production has been audited by various audit partners. This applies to the data availability layer, the bridge, and other parts of the system.
